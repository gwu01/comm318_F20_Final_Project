## My final project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

* The research question that encompasses my project is: is Philadelphia considered a safe location? As someone who frequently receives text messages warning me about dangers in the Greater Philadelphia region, I am curious to understand the crime scene dynamic more and whether or not we've seen positive change in the past few years. The project examines the breakdown of different crime cases reported by the Philadelphia Police department in the last 5 years as well as the timing of when these occurrences happened. It also utilizes data regarding complaints made against police officers to gauge people's trust and satisfaction with the workforce. Between these two factors, I found patterns in crime behavior within the scope of drug crimes, theft crimes, and rape crimes in terms of time of day in which they occur and hotspot locations. It's evident that certain areas in Philadelphia are more dangerous / more prone to danger than others (i.e. Kensington Ave), and that the police workforce still needs more improvement in certain areas that may be charged with racial stereotypes.
