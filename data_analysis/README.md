## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the a series of Jupyter notebooks you create to do the data analysis.

* Update this README file to document the notebooks and give a short description of what each one does.


### Data Analysis Notebooks

* `initial_data_exploration_assignment5` -- this notebook starts to explore the initial data files uploaded to the data folder. I explore preliminary trends in the Philly crime dataset, which outlines all the reports made by the Philadelphia Police Department in a given year. I recode the variables to make it more understandable from a data analysis standpoint (which will be consistent in the later notebooks!). Finally, I examine trends such as most frequent crimes, and what time of day they tend to occur to draw patterns for future analyses. 
* `data_exploration_assignment6` -- there are two buckets of data sets I will be examining: 1) the types of Philly crimes (from 2015 - 2020, each year constitutes its own data set) and 2) complaints made against police officers, the demographics of the police indicted, and the demographics of those who filed the complaints against the police (from 2015 - 2020).  
* `data_exploration_assignment7` -- my main focus of this assignment was to analyze the combined 2015-2020 data sets from the 1st bucket! In this combined dataset, I explore the trends that occur within drug crimes, theft crimes, and rape crimes, including popular areas that reports stem from, popular times that they occur, and days / times during the year where certain crimes hit their peak. 
* `Further_analysis` -- there will be a lot of overlap from the code I run here in comparison to the code from the other assignment notebooks! The main purpose of the analyses here is to derive the charts that I will be using in my final data story presentation. No new trends, just wanted to consolidate all of the graphics in one place since my kernel was crashing with my other notebooks!
