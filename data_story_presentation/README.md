## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the output of all your data analysis. You can choose how you want to present your data story.

* Data Story: https://gwu01.medium.com/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-but-is-it-safe-f503ff6f309c

* As mentioned earlier, my data story seeks to answer the question: is Philadelphia considered safe? 

* Since I am targeting millenials / a younger audience, I chose to represent my findings in a Medium article, similar to the style of a "blog post" but with a heavier focus on data analysis than colloquial reading. Philadelphia is home to many colleges and universities, and as a result, it experiences many new visitors every year. It is with this intent that I framed my data story, especially since populated areas seem to be more prone to crime.

* Medium articles are a more sophisticated and user-friendly way of portraying a story, offering a great platform to share advice. The seamless integration with visualizations was a wonderful opportunity for me to apply a more data-centric approach to my story. 

* My project tries to show a more holistic approach to analyzing the crime scene in Philadelphia rather than honing in on the headline articles that frequently make it to the Internet (that may result in baseline neglect). As someone who frequently receives safety notifications from UPennAlert, I was also curious to see myself if the University of Pennsylvania was situated in an argubly "safe" area. Overall, my project demonstrates that Philadelphia as a whole contains many segmented locations that contribute their own representative frequencies to certain types of crimes (i.e. Kensington Avenue). 

* The data story breaks down with a general scope of Philadelphia's crime analysis in the past few years from online sources, followed by a deeper analysis into three types of crime that exist within the Philadelphia ecosystem: drugs, theft, and rape. It then follows into a brief overview of the Philadelphia Police Department, and the issues and controversies that have arisen in the workforce. 

* In this data_story_presentation folder there are also copies of the interactive visualizations embedded in my blog post. 

* Thank you so much for a meaningful and extremely knowledgeable semester! This class has taught me more than any other course at Penn, and I am so glad I decided to begin my coding journey here!
